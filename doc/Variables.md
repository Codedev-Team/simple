# Variables.
Variables are  placeholders for values which can be strings, array / List, number, boolean etc.

## Declaring varibles in simple.
In SIMPLE, variables are defined without any prefix. I mean, we don't have to add a prefix like JavaScript's`let` or C's `int` etc. We have different variable types or do I say data structures that enable us determine the type ofvariable we're declaring. We have:
+ string
+ number
+ List
+ boolean
Below, is a code block that shows the variable declaration of all listed variable types.
```
name = "SIMPLE" # String variable declaration.
age = 1 # Number variable declaration.
List = ["s", "I", "M", "P", "L", "E"] # List type declaration.
```
