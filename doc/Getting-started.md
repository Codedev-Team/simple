## Installing SIMPLE & it's enviroment.
SIMPLE can be installed on any operating system. Be it Windows, Linux or Unix OS* and even Mac. In this section, i'll discuss how we can install in all OS'es.
#### Unix / Linux Os.
To install **SIMPLE** on a Unix / Linux OS, grab the latest release of the Linux package from [here](https://github.com/simple-lang/simple/releases). Choose the suitable OS type and download.
Upon downloading, you'll unzip and install. Open your terminal:
```sh
$ unzip simple-release-version.zip & cd simple-release-version
$ cd build & chmod +x Linux-build.sh 
$ sudo ./Linux-build.sh -c -i
# This check and configures your system (-c) and then install (-i)
```
Boom!. SIMPLE has been installed and enviroments and modules have also been added.
