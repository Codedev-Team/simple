# List.

A list is a data type that holds variables of all type be it character, string, function, number etc. The members of this data type are enclosed in `[]`. They have the same functions / features as Arrays have in JavaScript. Example of a List:

```

myList = ["bread", "jam", "egg"]

display myList # bread, jam and egg.

```

## Declaring List.
As earlier discussed in [Low and High ordered variables](Low and High ordered variables.md), we can declare List in two ways but in this chapter, we'll be discussing `Lists` declared from parent class. We'll also discuss the methods attached to them.
