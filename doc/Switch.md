# The Switch statement.
The switch statement, is a replacement for `if-else` statements. The switch statement reduces the numerous `if-else` statement that might occur in large apps. In a `switch` statement, there are two compulsory parameters: `case` and `default`. The case replaces the `if-else` statement and the `default` represents the final `else` statement. Let's glance through an example so as to better explain the syntax:
```


switch (n) 
	case 2
		display "it is two"
	case 3 
		display "it is three"
	default
		display "i dont know but it "+n
end 

```
