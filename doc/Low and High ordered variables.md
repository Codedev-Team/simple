# Low And High Level Ordered Variables.
Declaring variables is easy but what are Low and High level ordered variables ?. I'll break the mystery. First let's discuss the declaration techniques.

In simple-lang, we can declare strings and lists in two ways: either by using the normal declaration method ( traditional method ) or declaring variables from their parent classes. In a nutshell, there are two methods for declaring variables: traditional method and inheriting class. Let's look at an example:
``` Declaring a String and List traditionally.
# Let's declare a string traditionally.

name = "Simple-lang"

# Let's declare a list traditionally.
myList = ["code", "eat", "read", "hack"]

```
